Check my dev blog about this project at [my website's blog](https://zeeebrag.pro/blog/kanban-app-dev-journey).

## Feature

- Normal kanban app functionalities: add, drag, edit cards.
- Overlay card editor
- Beautiful and responsive UI/UX
- Save data at local browser

## Future work

- Animated SVG, Customized SVG
- Text ellipsis for card title when the title is over 2 lines.
- Implement in Next.js (it seems to be troublesome with useState).
